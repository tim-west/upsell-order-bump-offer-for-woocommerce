Upsell Order Bump Offer for WooCommerce provides a unique form of a well-timed offer as a checkout bump. This is a one-time exclusive offer that allows the customers to purchase things at a well-valued price.

The Order Bump offer can be accepted in just a single click in which the customer can just simply tick the checkbox to add the offer to their existing order.

You can trigger your WooCommerce checkout offers based on the target Category of products, For example, if anyone purchases a product from the Electronics category then your Order Bump offer will be triggered and the offer will be shown.

Setting up the target category saves a lot of time from adding individual products as targets and you can set up related upsell offers that will show up for the right category.

The Order Bumps can be scheduled for specific weekdays which can make them exclusive and available only for that set period of time.
